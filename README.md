# Data-Migration-and-Transformation-Pipeline

> This project uses AWS, PySpark to collect, extract, migrate, and analyze big data effectively

> The process involves using API requests and zip file libraries to extract the data locally, migrating the data to an Amazon S3 data lake, loading the required data into an Amazon RDS data warehouse, and finally processing and analyzing the data using PySpark and SQL queries. This approach enables efficient management and analysis of large datasets, empowering data-driven decision-making and insights


# Code Breakdown

1) Data Collection and Extraction  
  Obtain the ZIP file containing the big data from a reliable source.
  Use API requests with appropriate headers to download the ZIP file.
  Create a destination directory on the local machine to store the extracted data.
  Extract the contents of the ZIP file using zip file libraries.
  Verify the successful extraction of the data.
  Data Migration to Amazon S3 Data Lake

2) Set up an Amazon S3 bucket to serve as the data lake.
  Establish appropriate permissions and access controls for the bucket.
  Upload the extracted data to the S3 bucket's Folder.
  Ensure the data is organized and structured in a way that facilitates further processing and analysis.
  Data Loading into Amazon RDS Data Warehouse

3) Design a data warehouse schema that aligns with the required structure and relationships of the data.
  Create an Amazon RDS instance to host the data warehouse.
  Establish a connection to the RDS instance from the local machine.
  
4) PySpark to Load Data into RDS
  Create a Databricks community edition account.
  Utilize PySpark's data processing capabilities to transform and manipulate the data from S3 as per the defined schema.
  Implement a loading mechanism to transfer data from the S3 bucket to the RDS instance.
  Execute the loading process to populate the data warehouse with the required data.
  Data Processing and Analysis

5) Sample Qurey from RDS
  Write SQL queries in PySpark to retrieve specific subsets of data for analysis.
  Leverage PySpark's analytical functions and libraries to perform advanced data analysis tasks as requried.
